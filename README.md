## Q&A

**Will it get you VAC banned?**  
The program uses image recognition and does not access any game files, so it should be safe to use.

**After pressing `B`, it performs no action or random clicks.**  
This happens if the board wasn‚Äôt recognized correctly. Try replacing `topLeft.jpg` and `botRight.jpg` in the resource folder with your own screenshots. Make sure the center points of both images correspond to the top-left and bottom-right corners of the board.

**Clicked on a mine or freezing when a level is not finished.**  
If the program works fine most of the time, it‚Äôs likely that a cell number wasn‚Äôt recognized accurately. Try pressing `T` to turn off turbo mode, or simply retry a few more times.

**Cleared all levels, but the score wasn‚Äôt enough.**  
Try again.
